## Synopsis

Containerised simulation run-time.

```bash
# Run a simulation.
$ simer path/to/simulation -stepsize 0.0005 -endtime 0.04
```



## Simulation Setup

### Structure

The structure of a simulation is flexible and can be arranged based on individual
project needs. All paths used within a simulation configuration should be
relative to the root of the simulation folder (i.e. the simulation path).
The `simer` tool will search for YAML files contained within the _simulation path_ and
automatically configure, and then run, the contained simulation.

A simulation can be further structured by using several _Stack definitions_ to
partition parts of the simulation, each with its own runtime configuration.

### x32 Models

Models which should run as x32 processes can be configured in a Stack via the
`ModelInstanceRuntime:x32` property. When the `x32` property of a model instance
is set to `true`, the `simer` tool will run that model using a x32 version of the ModelC runtime.

> Note: stacked models run in a single ModelC runtime instance. Therefore, when an `x32` property
is set for one model in a set of stacked models, the x32 versions of _all_ stacked models will
be executed by the x32 version of the ModelC runtime.


#### Example x32 Model

<details>
<summary>simulation.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: simulation
spec:
  models:
    - name: x32_model_instance
      uid: 45
      model:
        name: X32_Model
      runtime:
        x32: true
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          alias: signal
```
</details>


### Remote Models

Simulations which contain remote models, such as Gateway models in foreign simulation environments or
Windows based models, can configure those remote models in a separate stack. When the simulation
is run by the `simer` tool, only selected stacks are started, and the remaining remote models
can then be started independently in their own environment.

> Hint: Models which need to be run with an older version of the `simer` tool can be defined in
their own stack and run independently (with an older version of Simer).


#### Example Remote Model

<details>
<summary>simulation.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: core
spec:
  models:
    - name: simbus
      model:
        name: simbus
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          expectedModelCount: 2
    - name: model_instance
      uid: 44
      model:
        name: Model
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          alias: signal
---
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: remote
spec:
  connection:
    transport:
      redispubsub:
        uri: redis://corehostname:6379
        timeout: 60
  models:
    - name: gateway_instance
      uid: 45
      model:
        name: GatewayModel
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          alias: signal
```
</details>


```bash
# Start the simulation (excluding Remote models).
$ simer path/to/simulation -stack core -endtime 0.1

# Now start the Remote models ...
```

### Stacked Models

Several models may be run stacked into a single ModelC runtime instance by setting
the `StackRuntime:stacked` property of their stack to `true`. The `simer` tool
will start _all_ models in that stack in a single instance of the ModelC runtime.

> Note: the `simbus` model, provided by the SimBus tool, is started independently of any runtime properties.


#### Example Stacked Model

<details>
<summary>simulation.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: simulation
spec:
  runtime:
    stacked: true
  models:
    - name: simbus
      model:
        name: simbus
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          expectedModelCount: 2
    - name: model_instance
      uid: 44
      model:
        name: Model
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          alias: signal
    - name: stacked_instance
      uid: 45
      model:
        name: Model
      channels:
        - name: signal_channel
          alias: signal
```
</details>


### Environment & Files

__Environment variables__ may be specified in either the `StackRuntime:env` or
`ModelInstanceRuntime:env` properties, or with the `-env` CLI option. The
environment variables are passed by the `simer` tool to the ModelC runtime in
the order that they are defined, `StackRuntime` environment variables first, and then
`ModelInstanceRuntime` variables, and lastly those specified via the `-env`
flag(s). Values set later will overwrite earlier values (or any existing
environment variables).

__Additional Files__ may be specified in the `ModelInstanceRuntime:files` property. The path
of each listed file should be relative to _simulation path_ or an _absolute path_.


#### Example with Env & Files

## Simmer Tool


### Setup

Simer is a containerised simulation run-time which can be setup using
a number of techniques. Container images are available and released with each
new version of the ModelC project.

```bash
# Latest Simer Container:
$ docker pull ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:latest

# Specific versions of the Simer Container
$ docker pull ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:2.0.7
$ docker pull ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:2.0
```

#### Shell Function

```bash
# Define a shell function (or add to .profile file).
$ export SIMER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:latest
$ simer() { ( if test -d "$1"; then cd "$1" && shift; fi && docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/sim -p 2159:2159 $SIMER_IMAGE "$@"; ) }

# Run the simulation.
$ simer dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/minimal -endtime 0.04
```


### Options

$ simer -h

### Tmux Interface

```bash
$ simer dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/minimal -endtime 0.04 -tmux
```

The terminal multiplexer _[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)_ is a technical CLI interface which makes it easy to observe the output of simulations which comprised of several models.
When using the _tmux_ interface each Model is represented in its own terminal window and it is possible to switch between terminal windows using keyboard shortcuts. Some of these shortcuts are listed below.


#### Tmux Keyboard Shortcuts

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __c__</tt>
: Create new window.

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __p__</tt>
: Select previous window.


<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __n__</tt>
: Select next window.


<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __0..9__</tt>
: Switch between _tmux_ windows.

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __w__</tt>
: List windows.

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __[__</tt>
: Enter copy mode. Use _VI_ keys to move cursor around the window (__q__ to quit copy mode).

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __PgUp__</tt>
: Enter copy mode and scroll up. Use _VI_ keys to move cursor around the window (__q__ to quit copy mode).

In copy mode use:

<tt>__Spacebar__</tt>
: Start selection.

<tt>__Esc__</tt>
: Clear selection.

<tt>__Enter__</tt>
: Copy selection.

<tt>__/__</tt>
: Search forwards.

<tt>__?__</tt>
: Search backwards.

Finally, use:

<tt>__Ctrl__+__b__  __d__</tt>
: Detach from the _tmux_ session (__and exit the simulation!__).


### GDB Debug

#### GDB

Models (and the SimBus) running in a simulation can be run under GDB to facilitate
interactive debugging. This method of debugging requires the use of the Tmux
interface.

```bash
# Start the simulation with the SimBus running under GDB.
$ simer dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/gdb -tmux -gdb simbus -endtime 0.04  -timeout 5

# Start the simulation with a model and the SimBus running under GDB.
$ simer dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/gdb -tmux -gdb simbus,gdb_inst -endtime 0.04  -timeout 5
```


#### GDB Server (remote)

Models running in a simulation can be debugged with GDB by indicating which model
is being debugged via the option `-gdbserver`, and then connecting a GDB instance to
that model running "remotely" in the Simer simulation.

```bash
# Start the simulation and indicate the Model being debugged.
$ simer dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/gdb -endtime 0.04 -tmux -gdbserver gdb_inst

# Start GDB (in a second terminal), and connect to the simulation.
$ gdb dse/modelc/build/_out/bin/modelc
(gdb) set solib-search-path dse/modelc/build/_out/examples/gdb/lib
(gdb) target remote localhost:2159
(gdb) continue
(gdb) bt
```
