## SimMock and CMocka Testing for Model Developers

The DSE ModelC Library includes a SimMock source code library which may be
used to develop integration tests for Models. With the SimMock library, a
Model Developer is able to easily develop CMocka Testcases which:

* Validate a model configuration and confirm the Models operation.
* Develop scenarios where expected signal exchange is verified.
* Inject network messages into the simulation or model (e.g. CAN frames) and read network messages.
* Check expected values for both scalars (Signals) and messages (Network).
* Stack several Model Instances within one SimMock and confirm their interoperation.
